# Structural Note

A desktop app for creating note with structural data. It is like having a small database inside a text file which you can define table structure (called section definition in Structural) and create / edit / delete a record (section element). In between the records, you can insert note in plain text or markdown format. 

The app create and store the note in a custom format `.structnote`. If you wish to share it with the others, you can share the file to let them open it with Structural Note App or export the note in a different format.
